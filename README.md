# Macsploit-Py
Macsploit API but Python


# Run
- Put in a new text file called msapipy.py or download it
- Run with python3 py or python
- Should work out of the box

```python3 msapipy.py```
# Notes
- Run when you have installed the trial or bought macsploit
- Python because I like it (and because the other msapi in python don't work and not updated)
- Can be used in your own projects (as long as you shout me out and the repo)
- Macsploit needs to be closed for this work 
- enjoy (real trust im telling you)
  

# Updates
- When there is new execution update method or update to Macsploit API it will be updated but yeah for now just sitting there
- Maybe occasional fixes and tweaks (don't have time for it lol)
